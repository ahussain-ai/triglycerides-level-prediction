#### Triglycerides Level Prediction
#### Overview
This project aims to predict triglyceride levels using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood, formed from excess calories and stored in fat cells. 
They are released for energy between meals. Monitoring triglyceride levels is crucial because high levels can lead to health issues like heart disease, stroke, and pancreatitis.
By accurately predicting triglyceride levels based on various features in the dataset, this project helps in early detection and management of these conditions, potentially improving patient outcomes.
